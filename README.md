# Asian options: an attempt at pricing and hedging

The goal of this project is to study pricing and hedging of Asian options. Asian options are widely used in commodity, energy, and currency markets because their average-based payoff reduces sensitivity to short-term volatility, manipulation, or illiquidity. This makes them a practical and more stable alternative to standard European-style derivatives.

We implement:
- an analytic model for geometric Asian options (closed-form Blackâ€“Scholes solution),
- a Monte Carlo model for arithmetic Asian options, and
- self-financing delta-hedging strategies for both.

Finally, we compare the performance of these models against simulated market conditions and real-world volatility data.

## Asian options basics
Recall that a European call option is a contract whose payoff at expiration is given by $\max(s_t - K, 0)$, where $K$ is the predetermined strike price and $s_t$ is the asset value at expiration time $t$.  By design, European call options are then path-independent, but also susceptible to "last-minute volatility".

Asian call (resp., put) options are an alternative contract trying to address the European option's susceptibility to short-term volatility, by defining the payoff at expiration to be $\max(\bar{S} - K, 0)$ (resp., $\max(K - \bar{S}, 0)$), where $\bar{S}$ is either the arithmetic average of the stock prices $\bar{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N s_{t_i}$ or the geometric average $\bar{S} = \left(\prod_{i=1}^N s_{t_i} \right)^{1/N}$, with $N$ being the number of subdivisions of the time interval $[0,t]$.  This feature makes Asian options especially useful in markets where prices can experience temporary spikes or manipulations near maturity such as commodities and energy or currency markets, or where participants want to smooth exposure to volatility.

The path-dependency of Asian options makes the problem of pricing them particularly interesting.  For one, geometric Asian option has a closed-form solution, while the arithmetic Asian option has not, and so one is naturally led to Monte-Carlo approaches.  Another possibly more interesting feature is that delta-hedging strategies need to take into account this path-dependence, as we will explain below.

## Pricing Asian options
Geometric Asian options have a closed-form pricing formula very similar to the classical Black-Scholes formula for European options.

>(call-put parity).

We implement a geometric Asian option pricing function in [Notebook 3](03_asian_options.ipynb).

Arithmetic options, on the other side, have no closed-form pricing formulas, and so we need to resort to Monte-Carlo methods for pricing them.  The pricing of arithmetic Asian options is also implemented in [Notebook 3](03_asian_options.ipynb).

### Simulation accuracy
By comparing the analytic and Monte-Carlo option pricing of geometric options, we conclude that a good balance between computational speed and accuracy is achieved between 10,000 and 100,000 simulations.  We use the latter when possible, and resort to small multiples of the former when necessary.

Specifically, for a 1-year call option with spot and strike price of $100.00, interest rate 4.25%, and volatility 0.43, we obtain the following.
```
Computed fair price: $9.78
Estimated call value with 10 simulations: $10.68 with standard error 5.79428
Estimated call value with 100 simulations: $9.88 with standard error 1.44013
Estimated call value with 1000 simulations: $9.52 with standard error 0.52360
Estimated call value with 10000 simulations: $9.93 with standard error 0.16538
Estimated call value with 100000 simulations: $9.70 with standard error 0.05158
Estimated call value with 1000000 simulations: $9.73 with standard error 0.01636
```

### Comparison with Black-Scholes prices
Geometric Asian options have a lower expected return than European options, with the difference increasing with increasing volatility.  They are also, as expected, less susceptible to volatility.

### Comparison between geometric and arithmetic options
Arithmetic options have a higher return than geometric ones, which should be expected since geometric means are bounded above by arithmetic means.

Arithmetic options look also more susceptible to volatility, which can be explained by the fact that geometric averages are more susceptible to small prices and less to large prices than arithmetic averages.  In fact, there seems to be a correlation between the difference in returns and volatility, with difference in returns being higher for higher volatility.

### Profit distribution
As with European options, the simulated profit distribution of Asian options has mean equal to the expected analytic price (at least for geometric options), but has a very long tail to the right (i.e. very large gains are possible).  Below are simulated profit distributions for one 1-year Asian call option with spot and strike prices $100.00, interest rate 4.5%, and volatility 0.4.

A market-maker willing to contrast the chances of unlikely extreme losses then has to resort to delta-hedging.

## $\Delta$-hedging Asian options
Because geometric options have a closed-form solution, we use the formula to compute the delta of geometric options, and use that as a proxy for the delta of arithmetic options as well.  An alternative strategy would be to simulate the delta via Monte-Carlo, by taking small difference quotients, but that is too computationally expensive.

In [Notebook 4](04_asian_hedging.ipynb), using the same notation as before, we find the delta of geometric call options to be 
$$
\Delta_{C_0} = e^{(b-r)t} \Phi(d_1),
$$
and the delta for put options to be
$$
\Delta_{P_0} = \Delta_{C_0} - e^{(b-r)t} = e^{(b-r)t} \left( \Phi(d_1) - 1 \right).
$$

### Naive hedging
A first naive attempt at hedging Asian options is to just follow the blueprint given by the European option strategy, i.e. by using the formula above to compute delta at every step and use that to rebalance the portfolio.  This however performs rather poorly:

![Naive geometric hedging](pictures/GAO_naive_hedging.png)

Note that the average simulated profit is always significantly less than the expected profit from the analytic formula.  Running the same simulation with a positive drift $\mu = 0.3$, one instead obtains large gains.  This suggests that the hedging strategy is failing somewhere.

A major issue is that the naive delta-hedging function is in fact discarding the path so far, and just computing delta as if the previous path did not matter.  Instead, one should keep track of the path so far, and compute delta conditionally on the (geometric) average up to the point.

One can express the conditional delta in terms of the standard delta with effective parameters.  At time $t_i$:
$$
\Delta_i(S_{t_i}, G_{t_i}) = \frac{\partial S_\text{eff}}{\partial S_{t_i}} \Delta_{C_0}(S_\text{eff}, K, \sigma_\text{eff}, t - t_i),
$$
where $G_{t_i}$ is the geometric average up to time $t_i$, $S_\text{eff} = G_{t_i}^{t_i/t} S_{t_i}^{1 - t_i/t}$ by the properties of geometric averages, and $\sigma_\text{eff} = \sigma \sqrt{\frac{t - t_i}{3t}}$.  One moreover computes $\frac{\partial S_\text{eff}}{\partial S_{t_i}} = \frac{t-t_i}{t} \frac{S_\text{eff}}{S_{t_i}}$.

Another problem with the naive delta-hedging approach is that it assumes that at each rebalancing step we are taking out or depositing the incremental P&L.  In other words, the portfolio does not have zero cash flow before maturity.  In real world, hedging portfolios instead are self-financing: at each step the portfolio holds $\Delta_i$ shares of stock and $B_i$ of cash/bonds.  Hence, the portfolio value is $V_i = \Delta_i S_i + B_i$.  The bond grows at the risk-free rate, and thus updates as $B_{i+1} = B_i e^{r dt}$, and there is no cash-flow entering or exiting the portfolio at intermediate times.

### Another attempt at delta-hedging
[Notebook 4](04_asian_hedging.ipynb) reimplements then the hedging strategy to use conditional deltas in a self-financing portfolio.  The outcome is still a bit off, but not as much as before.  The distribution of profits looks also more regular, and extreme values are less extreme, suggesting a partially working hedging strategy, that is however incomplete, likely reasons being the mixing continuous geometric average formulas with discrete hedging, and the impossibility to perfectly delta hedge Asian options by only trading the underlying asset.

![Geometric hedging](pictures/GAO_hedging.png)

The arithmetic hedging strategy is less precise, as expected given that we are using deltas from the geometric one as proxies.

![Arithmetic hedging](pictures/AAO_hedging.png)

### Sensibility to drift
We can explore further the dependence on drift of our Asian option hedging strategy, by redoing the simulation with different amounts of drift: $\mu \in \{-0.4, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4\}$.

![Geometric hedging vs drift](pictures/GAO_hedging_drift.png)

![Arithmetic hedging vs drift](pictures/AAO_hedging_drift.png)

Note that, albeit imperfect, the geometric hedging strategy is fairly stable with respect to drift, showing a not-too-large positive correlation with drift, that gets more pronounced for large values of drift.

In arithmetic hedging, the strategy has more sensibility to the drift term, which should be expected since the delta used is the one of the geometric option.  In particular, larger losses occur, especially with positive drifts.  Note however that extreme events are quite sparse, and that the perfectly balanced portfolio (return of 0) is within one standard deviation from the mean for all drifts.
