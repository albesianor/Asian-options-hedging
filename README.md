# Asian options: an attempt at pricing and hedging

The goal of this project is to study pricing and hedging of [Asian options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_option). Asian options are widely used in commodity, energy, and currency markets because their average-based payoff reduces sensitivity to short-term volatility, manipulation, or illiquidity. This makes them a practical and more stable alternative to standard European-style derivatives.

We implement:
- an analytic model for geometric Asian options (closed-form Blackâ€“Scholes solution),
- a Monte Carlo model for arithmetic Asian options, and
- self-financing delta-hedging strategies for both.

Finally, we compare the performance of these models against simulated market conditions and real-world volatility data.

**TODO**
- expand abstract with results
- write index
- write repo structure
- write future follow-ups

## Asian options basics
Recall that a European call option is a contract whose payoff at expiration is given by $\max(s_t - K, 0)$, where $K$ is the predetermined strike price and $s_t$ is the asset value at expiration time $t$.  By design, European call options are then path-independent, but also susceptible to "last-minute volatility".

Asian call (resp., put) options are an alternative contract trying to address the European option's susceptibility to short-term volatility, by defining the payoff at expiration to be $\max(\bar{S} - K, 0)$ (resp., $\max(K - \bar{S}, 0)$), where $\bar{S}$ is either the arithmetic average of the stock prices $\bar{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N s_{t_i}$ or the geometric average $\bar{S} = \left(\prod_{i=1}^N s_{t_i} \right)^{1/N}$, with $N$ being the number of subdivisions of the time interval $[0,t]$.  This feature makes Asian options especially useful in markets where prices can experience temporary spikes or manipulations near maturity such as commodities and energy or currency markets, or where participants want to smooth exposure to volatility.

The path-dependency of Asian options makes the problem of pricing them particularly interesting.  For one, geometric Asian option has a closed-form solution, while the arithmetic Asian option has not, and so one is naturally led to Monte-Carlo approaches.  Another possibly more interesting feature is that delta-hedging strategies need to take into account this path-dependence, as we will explain below.

## Pricing Asian options
Geometric Asian options have a closed-form pricing formula very similar to the classical Black-Scholes formula for European options.

>**Theorem.** Assume that $S_t$ follows a GBM distribution with yearly volatility $\sigma$.  Assume also that the risk-free interest rate is $r$.  Let $K$ be the strike price and set

>$b = \frac{1}{2} \left(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{6} \right), \quad d_1 = \sqrt{3}\frac{\log\frac{S_0}{K} + \left(b + \frac{\sigma^2}{6}\right)t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - \frac{\sigma \sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{3}}.$

>(call-put parity).

We implement a geometric Asian option pricing function in [Notebook 3](03_asian_options.ipynb).

Arithmetic options, on the other side, have no closed-form pricing formulas, and so we need to resort to Monte-Carlo methods for pricing them.  The pricing of arithmetic Asian options is also implemented in [Notebook 3](03_asian_options.ipynb).

### Simulation accuracy
By comparing the analytic and Monte-Carlo option pricing of geometric options, we conclude that a good balance between computational speed and accuracy is achieved between 10,000 and 100,000 simulations.  We use the latter when possible, and resort to small multiples of the former when necessary.

Specifically, for a 1-year call option with spot and strike price of $100.00, interest rate 4.25%, and volatility 0.43, we obtain the following.
```
Computed fair price: $9.78
Estimated call value with 10 simulations: $10.68 with standard error 5.79428
Estimated call value with 100 simulations: $9.88 with standard error 1.44013
Estimated call value with 1000 simulations: $9.52 with standard error 0.52360
Estimated call value with 10000 simulations: $9.93 with standard error 0.16538
Estimated call value with 100000 simulations: $9.70 with standard error 0.05158
Estimated call value with 1000000 simulations: $9.73 with standard error 0.01636
```

### Comparison with Black-Scholes prices
Geometric Asian options have a lower expected return than European options, with the difference increasing with increasing volatility.  They are also, as expected, less susceptible to volatility.

### Comparison between geometric and arithmetic options
Arithmetic options have a higher return than geometric ones, which should be expected since geometric means are bounded above by arithmetic means.

Arithmetic options look also more susceptible to volatility, which can be explained by the fact that geometric averages are more susceptible to small prices and less to large prices than arithmetic averages.  In fact, there seems to be a correlation between the difference in returns and volatility, with difference in returns being higher for higher volatility.

### Profit distribution
As with European options, the simulated profit distribution of Asian options has mean equal to the expected analytic price (at least for geometric options), but has a very long tail to the right (i.e. very large gains are possible).  Below are simulated profit distributions for one 1-year Asian call option with spot and strike prices $100.00, interest rate 4.5%, and volatility 0.4.

A market-maker willing to contrast the chances of unlikely extreme losses then has to resort to delta-hedging.

## Hedging Asian options
Because geometric options have a closed-form solution, we use the formula to compute the delta of geometric options, and use that as a proxy for the delta of arithmetic options as well.  An alternative strategy would be to simulate the delta via Monte-Carlo, by taking small difference quotients, but that is too computationally expensive.

In [Notebook 4](04_asian_hedging.ipynb), using the same notation as before, we find the delta of geometric call options to be 

$\Delta_{C_0} = e^{(b-r)t} \Phi(d_1),$

and the delta for put options to be

$\Delta_{P_0} = \Delta_{C_0} - e^{(b-r)t} = e^{(b-r)t} \left( \Phi(d_1) - 1 \right).$

### Naive hedging
A first naive attempt at hedging Asian options is to just follow the blueprint given by the European option strategy, i.e. by using the formula above to compute delta at every step and use that to rebalance the portfolio.  This however performs rather poorly:

![Naive geometric hedging](pictures/GAO_naive_hedging.png)

Note that the average simulated profit is always significantly less than the expected profit from the analytic formula.  Running the same simulation with a positive drift $\mu = 0.3$, one instead obtains large gains.  This suggests that the hedging strategy is failing somewhere.

A major issue is that the naive delta-hedging function is in fact discarding the path so far, and just computing delta as if the previous path did not matter.  Instead, one should keep track of the path so far, and compute delta conditionally on the (geometric) average up to the point.

One can express the conditional delta in terms of the standard delta with effective parameters.  At time $t_i$:

$\Delta_i(S_{t_i}, G_{t_i}) = \frac{\partial S_\text{eff}}{\partial S_{t_i}} \Delta_{C_0}(S_\text{eff}, K, \sigma_\text{eff}, t - t_i),$

where $G_{t_i}$ is the geometric average up to time $t_i$, $S_\text{eff} = G_{t_i}^{t_i/t} S_{t_i}^{1 - t_i/t}$ by the properties of geometric averages, and $\sigma_\text{eff} = \sigma \sqrt{\frac{t - t_i}{3t}}$.  One moreover computes $\frac{\partial S_\text{eff}}{\partial S_{t_i}} = \frac{t-t_i}{t} \frac{S_\text{eff}}{S_{t_i}}$.

Another problem with the naive delta-hedging approach is that it assumes that at each rebalancing step we are taking out or depositing the incremental P&L.  In other words, the portfolio does not have zero cash flow before maturity.  In real world, hedging portfolios instead are self-financing: at each step the portfolio holds $\Delta_i$ shares of stock and $B_i$ of cash/bonds.  Hence, the portfolio value is $V_i = \Delta_i S_i + B_i$.  The bond grows at the risk-free rate, and thus updates as $B_{i+1} = B_i e^{r dt}$, and there is no cash-flow entering or exiting the portfolio at intermediate times.

### Another attempt at delta-hedging
[Notebook 4](04_asian_hedging.ipynb) reimplements then the hedging strategy to use conditional deltas in a self-financing portfolio.  The outcome is still a bit off, but not as much as before.  The distribution of profits looks also more regular, and extreme values are less extreme, suggesting a partially working hedging strategy, that is however incomplete, likely reasons being the mixing continuous geometric average formulas with discrete hedging, and the impossibility to perfectly delta hedge Asian options by only trading the underlying asset.

![Geometric hedging](pictures/GAO_hedging.png)

The arithmetic hedging strategy is less precise, as expected given that we are using deltas from the geometric one as proxies.

![Arithmetic hedging](pictures/AAO_hedging.png)

### Sensibility to drift
We can explore further the dependence on drift of our Asian option hedging strategy, by redoing the simulation with different amounts of drift: $\mu \in \{-0.4, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4\}$.

![Geometric hedging vs drift](pictures/GAO_hedging_drift.png)

![Arithmetic hedging vs drift](pictures/AAO_hedging_drift.png)

Note that, albeit imperfect, the geometric hedging strategy is fairly stable with respect to drift, showing a not-too-large positive correlation with drift, that gets more pronounced for large values of drift.

In arithmetic hedging, the strategy has more sensibility to the drift term, which should be expected since the delta used is the one of the geometric option.  In particular, larger losses occur, especially with positive drifts.  Note however that extreme events are quite sparse, and that the perfectly balanced portfolio (return of 0) is within one standard deviation from the mean for all drifts.


## Market comparison
In [Notebook 5](05_european_market_comparison.ipynb) and [Notebook 6](06_asian_market_comparison.ipynb) we compare our pricing models with real-world data obtained from `yfinance`.  Ideally, one would compare the price of Asian options obtained from the models described above with real-world prices of the same options.  However, `yfinance` does not provide prices for Asian options, preventing a direct comparison.

To work around this issue, in [Notebook 5](05_european_market_comparison.ipynb) we first compare Black-Scholes pricing of European calls to real-world call prices from `yfinance`.

Next, in [Notebook 6](06_asian_market_comparison.ipynb), we historically backtest the pricing model for Asian options.  The results for European calls help us interpret the backtest for Asian options.

In both cases, we will look at the following tickers:
- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (`SPY`),
- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (`VTI`),
- Apple Inc (`AAPL`),
- Microsoft Corp (`MSFT`).

### European options
`yfinance` provides daily data of call prices.  On Friday, October 17, 2025, we obtained the following call prices.

![VTI European calls](pictures/VTI_euro_calls.png)

![AAPL European calls](pictures/AAPL_euro_calls.png)

![MSFT European calls](pictures/MSFT_euro_calls.png)

>**Remark.** The analytic geometric Asian option prices are virtually indistinguishable from the arithmetic ones in the graph.

Note how the Black-Scholes prices approximately follow the market price, although they significantly underprice with respect to the market, with the error generally increasing in magnitude as the strike price increases.

Note also how the models give lower prices to the Asian calls, as expected.

From the point of view of market comparison of Asian options, the main takeaway is that, since B-S is underpricing European options compared to market prices, we should expect our Asian pricing models to be underpricing Asian options compared to hypothetical market prices.

### Asian options
In [Notebook 6](06_asian_market_comparison.ipynb), we take windows over historical data and compare the actual discounted payout of an array of Asian calls to the expected one for geometric calls (from the formula) and arithmetic calls (from the Monte-Carlo simulation), using realized volatility in the previous month as volatility in the GBM model.

The historical series starts on Jan 1, 2019 and ends on Dec 31, 2024.  We look at options expiring in 5 days, to be consistent with the European options market-comparison.  Averages are taken daily.

Since Asian options are mostly used for commodities, we will also backtest with
- [Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF](https://etfdb.com/etf/PDBC/#etf-ticker-profile) (`PDBC`),
- [SPDR Gold Shares](https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/) (`GLD`).

Note first that the average P&L is positive in all cases, but recall that the B-S/M-C pricing for European options seems to be systematically underpricing calls compared to their real market prices, which we can assume to be a reasonable proxy for future discounted realized payoffs.  A similar phenomenon is probably happening for Asian options too, and could explain the consistent positive average P&L.  This likely reflects the difference between the risk-neutral dynamics assumed by the model and the empirical (real-world) dynamics, in particular the presence of a volatility risk premium or deviations from log-normality.

Note also that, although the mean P&L is positive, the distribution is skewed, and the median is practically indistinguishable from 0 and has a very large count.

Finally, note that the standard deviation and 95% Value-at-Risk of P&L substantially exceed the mean in all cases, indicating that the modelâ€™s apparent profitability is not statistically or economically significant. The large dispersion and fat left tail imply that a market-maker using this strategy would face substantial risk of loss despite a positive expected P&L.
